# What is NAMB?

**NAMB** (Not only A Micro-Benchmark) is a fast and flexible prototype application generator for Data Stream Processing (DSP) platforms. With a simple description of the streaming workflow, NAMB will automatically generate the application for the specified DSP platform.

### Features
* **Generic**: NAMB is a modularized framework able to generate the benchmark for multiple platforms using the same configurations set.
* **Flexible**: NAMB has simple and intuitive configuration, giving the minimum set of parameters that allows the best application definition flexibility.
* **Available**: the software is made available to everyone through a GitHub repository; everyone is allowed to use it, test it and improve it.
