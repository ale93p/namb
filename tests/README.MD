Where testing is made

## CPU

### Objective

Find the CPU load from different tasks, so to define a load abstraction in the configurations.

### Methodology

Defined different common CPU-intensive DSP tasks categories[1-5]:

* Identity (i.e. "Input data processing without executing any operation on them" [5])
* Transformation (e.g. Parsing)
* Filter
* Windowing (e.g. Aggregation, Sorting):
  * Aggregation
  * Ranking
* ~~Join~~ ([merged with Windowing](https://github.com/ale93p/namb/issues/6#issuecomment-456091723))
* ~~Normalization (?)~~

These task have then been imolemented in a testing Storm topology and run in local mode to analyze their CPU consumption.

The tests has been run in a single machine. The version of Storm used is **1.2.2**. 
The cluster has been set with ZooKeeper, Nimbus and Supervisor co-existing in a single machine.
Each topology has been run over two workers:
* individual tasks benchmarks has been run in a spout->bolt manner.
* full topology tasks has been run as:
    ```

              Ranking
