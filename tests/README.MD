## CPU Load Abstraction

### Objective

Find the CPU load from different tasks, so to define a load abstraction in the configurations.

### Methodology

### Common DSP Tasks
Defined different common CPU-intensive DSP tasks categories[1-5]:

* Identity (i.e. "Input data processing without executing any operation on them" [5])
* Transformation (e.g. Parsing)
* Filter
* Windowing (e.g. Aggregation, Sorting):
  * Aggregation
  * Ranking
* ~~Join~~ ([merged with Windowing](https://github.com/ale93p/namb/issues/6#issuecomment-456091723))
* ~~Normalization (?)~~

#### Environment
- The tests has been run in a single machine. The version of Storm used is **1.2.2**. 
- The cluster has been set with ZooKeeper, Nimbus and Supervisor co-existing in a single machine.
- Each topology has been run over two workers.
- The base input throughput (Spout generation) is `1000tuples/s`.

#### Step 1
The common tasks has been tested one by one in a spout->task topology:
* Identity: `XMLSpout->IdentityBolt`
* Transformation: `XMLSpout->TransformationBolt`
* Filter: `RandomIntegerSpout->FilterBolt`
* Aggregation: `RandomIntegerSpout->AggregationBolt`
* Ranking: `RandomIntegerSpout->AggregationBolt`

#### Step 2
A sample topology has been built using the implementation of the common tasks, under the form:
```
         XMLSpout
            |
      Transformation
            |
          Filter
        /        \
Aggregation     Aggregation
        \        /
          Ranking
```

#### Step 3
The BusyWaitBolt has been run with different cycles values to get the CPU Load generated.

#### Step 4
Given the results ([BusyWait individual](#busywait-benchmark)) of the previous step,
has been implemented a topology using only BusyWait bolts, changing the cycles number
in ordet to simulate the load seen for the topology in [step 2](#step-2).

Between paranthesis the number of thousands of cycles set to simulate the tasks:
```
         XMLSpout
            |
      Transformation
          (400)
            |
          Filter
          (0.75)
        /        \
Aggregation     Aggregation
  (0.80)          (0.80)
        \        /
          Ranking
           (100)
```

### Findings

#### Common Tasks Benchmarks

| Common tasks individual  | Common tasks topology |
|-------------------|------------------|
|![](logs/plots/common_individual_boxplot.png)| ![](logs/plots/common_full_topo_boxplot.png)|

Small and not relevant difference when running in full topology.

#### BusyWait Benchmark

| BusyWait individual | BusyWait simulated topology |
|-------------------|------------------|
|![](logs/plots/busywait_individual_boxplot.png)| ![](logs/plots/busywait_full_topo_boxplot.png)|

In the figure on the right we can see that using the parameters previously described,
the simulated tasks replicates the same CPU Load than the real tasks.

#### Comparison with different input throughput

| Input Tput (t/s) | Common Tasks Topology | BusyWait Simulated Topology |
|------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
|   10 | ![](logs/plots/common_10_full_topo_boxplot.png)| ![](logs/plots/busywait_10_full_topo_boxplot.png)|
|  100 | ![](logs/plots/common_100_full_topo_boxplot.png)| ![](logs/plots/busywait_100_full_topo_boxplot.png)|
| 1000 | ![](logs/plots/common_full_topo_boxplot.png)| ![](logs/plots/busywait_full_topo_boxplot.png)|
|10000 | ![](logs/plots/common_10000_full_topo_boxplot.png)| ![](logs/plots/busywait_10000_full_topo_boxplot.png)|
