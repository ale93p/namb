# Tests Section

Where testing is made

## CPU

### Objective

Find the CPU load from different tasks, so to define a load abstraction in the configurations.

### Methodology

Defined different common CPU-intensive DSP tasks categories[1-5]:

* Identity (i.e. "Input data processing without executing any operation on them" [5])
* Transformation (e.g. Parsing)
* Filter
* Join
* Windowing (e.g. Aggregation, Sorting)
* ~~Normalization (?)~~

These task have then been imolemented in a testing Storm topology and run in localhost to analyze their CPU consumption.
